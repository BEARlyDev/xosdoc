				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>
				XOS (Experimental Operating System) is an experimental operating system  which is designed to be run on the  XSM  (Experimental String Machine) architecture which is a simulated machine hardware. XOS is 	intended as an instructional tool to help students learn various aspects about operating systems.
				</p>
				<p>
				XOS is programmed using a custom language, SPL (System Programmer's Language) which compiles to XSM compatible code. (Refer <a href="spl-spec.html" target="_blank" >SPL Specification</a>) Application programs for XSM are written in APL (Application Programmer's Language). (Refer <a href="apl-spec.html" target="_blank" >APL Specification</a>) 
				</p>
				<p>
				The programs, data and operating system code is stored on a disk which has an XFS (Experimental File 					System) in it. (Refer <a href="xfs-spec.html" target="_blank" >XFS Specification</a>)
				</p>
				
				
				The various functionalities of XOS include
				<ul>
				<li> <b>Process Management</b>, includes scheduling and dispatching processes to the CPU. XOS is 					capable of \textit{multiprogramming} (the ability to run more than one process simultaneously).	 					(Refer <a href="#navpromgmt" >Process Management</a>)
				</li>
				<li> <b>Memory Management</b>, involves allocating memory for processes, demand paging (loading 				memory pages from the disk as and when required). (Refer <a href="#navmemmgmt"  >Memory 				Management</a>) </li>
				<li> <b>System Calls</b>. XOS provides various system calls for the user processes to execute certain 					kernel level operations. (Refer <a href="#navsyscalls"  >System Calls</a> ) </li>

				<article id="navpromgmt_intro" class="grid col-full">
				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<p>Any program in its execution is called a <b>process</b>. Processes will be loaded into memory before they start their execution. Each process occupies at most 4 pages in of the memory. The processor generates logical addresses with respect to a process during execution, which is translated to the physical address. This translation is done by the machine using page tables, Refer <a href="xsm-spec.html#navaddr" target="blank"> Address Translation (XSM Specification)</a></p>
				
				
				<p>The XSM architecture supports demand paging and so the machine does not fix the number of processes that can be run on it. However XOS has limited the number of process running simultaneously to 32, due to limitations in number of <a href="#navpromgmt_pcb" >PCB</a>s in the Ready List and the number of <a href="#navpromgmt_pagetbl" ">Per-Process Page Tables</a>.</p>

				<ul>
				<li><b>Code Area</b> : These are pages of the memory that contain the executable code loaded from the disk.</li>
				<li><b>Stack</b> : This is the user stack used for program execution. The variables and data used during execution of program is stored in the stack. It grows in the direction of increasing word address.</li>

				</table>			
				
				<br/>
				<h5>Process Identifier (<tt>PID</tt>) </h5>	
				The process identifier is a number from 0 to 31, which identifies the processes in memory. The PID of the current process can be calculated from the PTBR register.
		
				</br></br>
					<h5>Process State (<tt>STATE</tt>)</h5>
					The process state corresponding to a process, indicated by STATE in the PCB stores the state of that process in the memory. A process can be in one of the following states.
					<ul>
					<li>0 for terminated, i.e. process has completed execution</li>
					<li>1 for ready, i.e. process is waiting for the CPU to start execution.</li>
					<li>2 for running, i.e. the process is currently running in the CPU</li>
					</ul>
				
					<h5>Registers</h5>
					<ul>	
					<li><tt>IP</tt>: The word address of the currently executing instruction is stored in the IP (Instruction Pointer) register. The value of this instruction cannot be changed explicitly by any instruction. </li>
					<li><tt>BP</tt>: The base address of the user stack is stored in the BP (Base Pointer)register.</li>
					<li><tt>SP</tt>: The address of the stack top is stored in the SP (Stack Pointer)</li>
					<li><tt>PTBR</tt>: TThe physical address of the Per-Process Page Table of the process is stored in the PTBR (Page Table Base Register).</li>
					<li><tt>PTLR</tt>: The length of the Per-Process Page Table (No. of entries) is stored in the PTLR (Page Table Length Register). It is fixed as 4 for every process in XOS.</li>		
					</ul>		
					<p>Each process has its own set of values for the various registers. Words 2 – 6 in
	the PCB stores the values of the registers associated with the process .</p>
	
	
					<h5>Per-Process Open File Table </h5>
					The Per-Process Open File Table contains details of files opened by the corre sponding process. Every entry in this  table occupies 2 words. A maximum of 8 files can be opened by a process at a time, i.e. up to 8 entries in the PCB. It is stored in the PCB from words 15 to 30. Its structure is given below 1 word Pointer to system-wide open file table entry 1 word LSEEK position

				<h4>Ready List</h4>
				<p>The list of PCBs stored in the memory is used as a Ready List by the operating system to schedule processes to CPU. The STATE in the PCB indicates whether a process is ready for execution or not. A new process in memory is scheduled for execution by circularly traversing through the list of PCBs stored in memory and selecting the first Ready process after the PCB of the currently running process in the list.</p>

				<p>  
				The Per-Process Page Table stores the physical page number corresponding to each logical page associated with the process. The logical page number can vary from 0 to 3 for each process. Therefore, each process has 4 entries in the page table. Per-Process Page Tables are stored in Page 2, words 1024 – 1279 in the memory (256 words = 32 processes × 4 pages )
				</p>
				<p>
					When a process is loaded only the disk addresses of the program are stored, and by demand paging (Refer <a href="#navmemmgmt_paging" >Paging</a>) pages are loaded/allocated for the process. Once all pages are loaded, each entry contains the page number where the data specified by the logical address resides in the memory and auxiliary information which includes valid/invalid bit, reference bit etc.

				<h4>Virtual Memory</h4>
				<p>XOS allows virtual memory management, i.e. running processes without having all the pages in memory. It makes use of a backing store or swap in the disk to replace pages from the memory and allocate the emptied memory to another process. This increases the total number of processes that can be run simulta neously on the OS.</p>
				<p>
				XOS starts executing a process with no pages of that process in memory. Pages are loaded into the memory from the disk only when it is required by the CPU. This strategy is known as pure demand paging. The page table is loaded with the disk address of the data blocks corresponding to the process and all entries are set as invalid and not referenced initially (‘00’ as auxiliary information).		</p>
				<p>
				Page Fault Exceptions occur when a required page is not currently loaded into the memory. In this case the Exception Handler Routine is responsible for loading the required page to the memory from the disk. If no free memory is available a page replacement technique is used to find a victim page. The page replacement technique used in XOS is a second chance algorithm(Refer Silberschatz, Galvin, Gagne: Operating System Concepts) which uses the reference 12 bits in the auxiliary information. The victim page is swapped out to to the disk (swap area) to accommodate the required page.</p>

Hence, any disk block that has to be read or written into is first brought into the scratchpad. It is then read or modified and written back into the disk.</p>
				<p>	The page number 1 of the memory is used as the scratchpad. Once the OS has booted up there is no need for the OS startup code. So this page can be reused as the scratchpad.</p>

			<h4>Introduction</h4>
			<p>System calls are interfaces through which a process communicates with the OS. Each system call has a unique name associated with it (Halt, Open, Read, Fork etc). Each of these names maps to a unique system call number. Each system call in turn causes an interrupt to occur. Note that multiple system calls can be mapped to the same interrupt.</p>
			<p> All the arguments to the system call are pushed into the user stack of the process which invokes the system call. The system call number is pushed as the last argument. (Refer <a href="apl-spec.html" target="_blank" >APL Specification</a>)  </p>

			<article id="navsyscalls_file" class="grid col-full">
			<h4>File System Calls</h4>
			<p>File system calls are used by a process when it has to create, delete or manipulate Data files that reside on the disk(file system). There are seven file system calls. An interrupt is associated with each system call. All the necessary arguments for a system call are available in the user stack with the system call number as the last argument. </p>
			
			<b>Create</b></br>
			<i>APL Syntax </i>: <tt>int Create(fileName)</tt> <br/>
			<i>System Call No. </i>: 1 <br/>
			
			<p>This system call is used to create a new file in the file system whose name is specified in the argument. The return value of the <tt>Create()</tt> system call is 0 if it is a success, and an error code otherwise. It calls Interrupt 1 Routine. </p>

			<b>Delete</b></br>
			<i>APL Syntax </i>: <tt>int Delete(fileDescriptor)</tt> <br/>
			<i>System Call No. </i>: 2 <br/>
			
			<p>This system call is used to delete the file from the file system whose name is specified in the argument. The return value of the  <tt>Delete()</tt> system call is 0 if it is a success, and an error code otherwise. It calls Interrupt 1 Routine.</p>
			
			<b>Open</b></br>
			<i>APL Syntax </i>: <tt>int Open(fileName)</tt> <br/>
			<i>System Call No. </i>: 3 <br/>
			
			<p>This system call is used to open an existing file whose name is specified in the argument. It calls Interrupt 2 Routine. The return value of the <tt>Open()</tt> system call is an integer value called FileDescriptor, which is the index of the corresponding file’s entry in the Per-Process Open File Table. </p>
			
			<b>Close</b></br>
			<i>APL Syntax </i>: <tt>int Close(fileName)</tt> <br/>
			<i>System Call No. </i>: 4 <br/>
			
			<p>his system call is used to close an open file. The file can only be closed by the process which opened it. FileDescriptor is an integer value returned by the corresponding <tt>Open()</tt> system call. The return value of the <tt>Close()</tt> system call is 0 if it is a success, and an error code otherwise. It calls Interrupt 2 Routine. </p>
			
			<b>Seek</b></br>
			<i>APL Syntax </i>: <tt>iint Seek(FileDescriptor, lseek)</tt> <br/>
			<i>System Call No. </i>: 5 <br/>
			
			<p>This system call is used to change the current value of the seek position in the global file table entry of a file. The return value of the <tt>Seek()</tt> system call is 0 if it is a success, and an error code otherwise. It calls Interrupt 3 Routine. </p>
			
			<b>Read</b></br>
			<i>APL Syntax </i>: <tt>int Read(fileDescriptor, memoryLocation, numWords)</tt> <br/>
			<i>System Call No. </i>: 6 <br/>
			
			<p>This system call is used to read data from an open file (identified by fileDescriptor)
to the memory (identified by memoryLocation). The return value of the <tt>Read()</tt> system call is the number of words successfully read from the file or an error code otherwise. It calls Interrupt 3 Routine. </p>
			
			<b>Write</b></br>
			<i>APL Syntax </i>: <tt>int Write(fileDescriptor, memoryLocation, numWords)</tt> <br/>
			<i>System Call No. </i>: 7 <br/>
			
			<p>This system call is used to write data into an open file (identified by fileDescriptor)
to the memory (identified by memoryLocation). The return value of the <tt>Write()</tt> system call is the number of words successfully written to the file or an error code otherwise. It calls Interrupt 4 Routine. </p>

			<article id="navsyscalls_process" class="grid col-full">
			<h4>Process System Calls</h4>
			<p>Process system calls are used by a process when it has to duplicate itself, execute a new process in its place or when it has to terminate itself. There are three process system calls. An interrupt is associated with each system call. All the necessary arguments for a system call are available in the user stack with the system call number as the last argument. </p>
			
			<b>Fork</b></br>
			<i>APL Syntax </i>: <tt>int Fork()</tt> <br/>
			<i>System Call No. </i>: 8 <br/>
			
			<p>This system call is used to replicate the process which invoked this system call in the memory. The new process which is created is known as the child and the process which invoked this system call is known as its parent. The return value of the <tt>Fork()</tt> system call is ystem call to the parent process is the PID (process identifier) of the child process.It calls Interrupt 5 Routine </p>

			<b>Exec</b></br>
			<i>APL Syntax </i>: <tt>int Exec(filename)</tt> <br/>
			<i>System Call No. </i>: 9 <br/>
			
			<p>This system call is used to load the program, whose name is specified in the argument, in the memory space of the current process and start its execution. The return value of the <tt>Exec()</tt> system call is 1 if it is a success, and and 0 otherwise. It calls Interrupt 6 Routine.</p>
			
			<b>Exit</b></br>
			<i>APL Syntax </i>: <tt>Exit()</tt> <br/>
			<i>System Call No. </i>: 10 <br/>
			
			<p>This system call is used to terminate the execution of the process which invoked it and removes it from the memory . It loads the next available process. It calls Interrupt 7 Routine.</p>

			<h4>OS Startup Code</h4>
			<p>The OS Startup Code resides in the page 1 in the memory. When the machine boots up the ROM Code (Refer XSM Specification) loads the OS Startup Code from the disk . The OS Startup code initializes all data structures required for the OS, loads the FAT and Disk Free List from file system into the memory and starts execution of the <tt>INIT</tt> process. </p>

			<article id="navsysroutines_exhandler" class="grid col-full">
			<h4>Exception Handler</h4>
			<p>When the machine encounters an exception it sets EFR (Exception Flag Register) with details corresponding to the exception and calls the exception handler routine (Page No. 7 in memory). (Refer <a href="xsm-spec.html#navexcep" target="blank"> Exceptions in XSM</a>) </p>
			
			<img src="doc/EFR-structure.png" style="width:40%" width="20%">
			<p>XOS handles all exceptions other than Page Fault by killing the process
which caused the exception.
			<h5> Page Fault Exceptions </h5>
			<p>The Cause field of EFR for Page Fault Exceptions is 0. Once a page fault occurs, the Exception Handler Routine loads the required page to the memory from the 20 disk, if it does not exist. The corresponding entry for the logical page which caused the exception to occur (indicated by BadVAddr field in EFR ) will be invalid in the page table of the process. </p>

			<h4>Timer Interrupt Routine</h4>
			<p>The Timer Interrupt Routine is responsible for context switch, i.e. storing the state (values of the registers) of the currently executing process to the PCB, and setting the registers with values from the PCB of the next ready process in the Ready List of PCBs. A scheduler is responsible for selecting a ready process from this list. The Scheduler code is also contained in the Timer Interrupt Routine.</p>
